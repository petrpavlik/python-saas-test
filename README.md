# Python Playground

This is a playground as I'm learning more about [Python](https://www.python.org) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) by slowly re-creating the backend for [IndiePitcher](https://indiepitcher.com), or more closely my [SAAS backend template](https://github.com/petrpavlik/vapor-saas-backend-template) using [Swift](https://swift.org) and [Vapor](https://vapor.codes).

I've also made some [YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/Uwhh-sJK748?si=PbpQJjhAgEFAfB1U) explaining the code base.

A big inspiration is the source code of [Polar](https://polar.sh).

## Instalation
- Clone this repo, obviously
- Open the project in Visual Studio code to start up the venv (or start it manually)
- Fetch the dependencies using `uv sync`
- That's it, the project currently uses SQLite and does not need any external services to run
